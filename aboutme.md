---

I'm a Vietnamese-American son of immigrants trying to find my way in the cycle of nirvana. I'm passionate about building the future via scalable and responsible information systems, as well as helping empower low-income communities of color via economic development and education.

My personal interests include photography, cooking, beatboxing, and a cappella.

I am currently located in Westminster, CA. I've also lived for several months at a time in both India and Japan.

<!-- My name is Inigo Montoya. I have the following qualities:

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions. -->
