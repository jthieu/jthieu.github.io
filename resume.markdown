### Amazon Web Services

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT INTERN

JUNE 2019 – SEPTEMBER 2019

As part of a DevOps team, I helped build a new feature for AWS enterprise clients to aggregate their license usage metrics. I integrated my feature with existing testing pipelines and wrote extensive tests to ensure functionality.

### Infosys

SOFTWARE ENGINEERING INTERN

JUNE 2018 – AUGUST 2018

I worked on a project to take Java source code from small-to-mid size clients, automatically parse it via ANTLR, and determine microservice candidates for clients to modernize their codebases. I also worked with a small team of six to develop a frontend UI for clients to interact with the microservice recommender software.

After the conclusion of my internship, the microservice recommender was pitched to potential clients in Australia.

### Teens Exploring Technology

FELLOW

MAY 2017 – AUGUST 2017

As a TXT fellow, I served as both instructor and mentor for the Summer Coding Leadership Academy. Over the course of 8 weeks, we took a cohort of under-resourced young men of color from Los Angeles through the process of building a startup.

Within the span of 8 weeks, we went from ideation to creating an MVP. As their mentor, I taught the technical and business sides of startup development. These skills included MEAN Stack, market research, and UI/UX design. Whenever necessary, I would jump in to directly assist with blockers.

After I left, my old team went on to win a $5,000 grant to continue developing the MVP that we created.
